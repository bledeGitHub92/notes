### 直接宾语和间接宾语

**直接宾语和间接宾语** 有些及物动词，如：give, show, pass, send, bring, etc.可以有两个宾语。

这种动词要求的两个宾语，往往一个指人，一个指物。指人的叫间接宾语，指物的叫直接宾语。

**间接宾语一般放在直接宾语之前**

    Lend [ me ] your [ pen-knife ], please.
    Excuse me, please. Could you tell [ me ] the [ way ] to the post office?
    Uncle yang taught [ Xiao Yang how to grow rice ].
    Can you tell [ me when the next train leaves ]?

    Do you see the hammer here? Hand it [ to me ], please.
    I've got three tickets here. Please give them to [ comrede Li ].

**强调间接宾语** 把作为直接宾语的名词放在前面，把带 to 的间接宾语放在后面，这是为了强调间接宾语。

    I sent a telegram [ to him ] yesterday.

#### 间接宾语

**同源宾语（cognate object）** 有些不及物动词如 live，die，sleep，smile，dream，fight，laugh 等后面可有一个与它意义相同的同源宾语。

    Dong Cunrui, a fine menber of Chinese Communist Party, [ died ]  a martye's [ death ].
    The former poor peasants of the village [ lived ] a miserable [ life ] before liberation.

还有 to sleep a sleep，to dream a dream，to fight a fight 等。

#### 复合宾语

**复合宾语** 英语有些及物动词，除了要有一个直接宾语之外，还要加上宾语补足语 (object complement)，句子的意义才算完整。宾语和宾语补足语一起构成复合宾语。由于复合宾语中的宾语和它的补足语在逻辑上有主语和谓语的关系，所以这样的宾语也叫做逻辑主语，它的补足语也叫做逻辑谓语。

    Call [ me ] [ Lao Wang ].
    The landlord made [ Gao Yubao ] [ get up ] before dawn every day.

**宾语补足语表示法** 在复合宾语中，能作宾语补足语的有名词和形容词，以及其他某些相当于名词和形容词的词语。
